# UofT-CSC111-Project
This is our course project for CSC111H1 (2021 Winter): Foundations of Computer Science II, at the University of Toronto.

We made a video game recommendation system that recommends video games to Steam users based on their personal references and the games that they have already played in the past. The implementation of this system involves decision trees, weighted graphs, and Pygame, but rest assured that you don't need to know anything about them (or have a Steam account) to be able to use this program.
